### Hi there 👋
👋 Hi there! I'm a computer science and technology student with a strong interest in 💻 software engineering and 🎨 UX design. I have experience working with various programming languages, including C++, Swift, Python, and ReactJS. Additionally, I have experience in project management and leadership, having worked as a 🚀 full-stack developer and SCRUM master.

I'm also passionate about entrepreneurship and have completed a diploma in this area, developing a 🚕 ride-hailing app prototype as part of my coursework. I'm a skilled communicator, having spoken at several events on topics such as 🎥 animated influence and 🤖 stylization AI in animation.
